00:01 So you saw a little bit of the project structure, but let's focus on the individual details,
00:05 so you can see where to go to configure
00:08 or write code to affect a certain part of the app.
00:11 So I used the tree command, which you can brew install onto MacOS,
00:15 to give me a hierarchical view here.
00:17 So at the top, we have our project root I'm in the main directory
00:20 that was created, the one that has the setup.py and things like that;
00:25 over here, you'll see that there are some package management files,
00:28 there's some read only details that get pulled in
00:31 as well as the setup.py which is the most important thing
00:34 that installs the dependencies,
00:36 that installs the website as a package itself, and so on.
00:40 Next, we have our web application root, this is almost always
00:44 the exact same name as your root directory,
00:46 your package root but is a subdirectory of that,
00:50 so here we have auto service api, there is really the root of our service
00:53 and in here we have the __init__ which represents the entry point to this package,
00:58 and that is the entry point into your web application.
01:01 So this is where the start up and configuration code part of it goes,
01:04 we've got our static client side cached files here,
01:08 we have our dynamic view folder, so our templates
01:12 we're going to pass the models to the Chameleon, Jinja 2
01:16 or whatever type of templates and they're going to turn that into pure html
01:19 and those are in the templates folder here,
01:21 we have a my template in a layout,
01:23 the layout is like the overall look and feel for the site
01:25 and my template just brings in what's different about that page.
01:29 So you should really look at how those fit together
01:32 if you are adding more pages along the same line.
01:34 We have the code that is going to run our tests,
01:36 there is some basically starter example code
01:39 on how to create a test version of your app,
01:42 started up but not actually run the web server
01:45 and then make requests, fake requests, and things like that to it.
01:49 So if you want to write tests, you definitely want to look there.
01:52 And you'll be spending a lot of time in the dynamic view folder,
01:54 so here's where you write the functions that are your mapping routes
01:59 to that actually do the work; now it doesn't have to live in this views folder,
02:02 like I strongly encourage you not to put
02:05 every single part of your website to the single file, that would be very wrong;
02:09 we'll see one of the first things we do is organize this into a different structure,
02:12 but by default this is the structure they use and that's where your views live.
02:16 Finally, we have our configuration files here,
02:19 so we've got our development.ini and our production.ini the idea is
02:23 you run the development one in development and the production one in production,
02:27 but it's really just the command line arguments you set up to run.
02:30 So now you have a better understanding of all the working parts
02:33 of your website, it's time to start writing some actual service code.
