00:01 So it looks like we have Pyramid installed, our web app created,
00:04 registered, and we've been able to run it,
00:07 but it's no fun to have a web app if you can't edit it, right,
00:10 and we're going to use PyCharm to do that.
00:12 So let me show you how to configure this in PyCharm.
00:15 So basically we want access to the directory we're in
00:18 so I'll say open. on Windows it's start.
00:21 and here's the project structure that got created,
00:24 and in here, you can't see it, is the hidden.env
00:27 so on MacOS, I can drop this on PyCharm
00:31 and it will automatically open it up and understand this project,
00:35 I believe you've got to open PyCharm and say
00:38 file open directory on Linux and Windows.
00:40 So it comes to life you can see it's thinking about
00:43 all of the dependencies and libraries that are installed
00:46 so give it just a second to come to terms with that,
00:48 and notice it's also automatically detected
00:51 the project up here as a Pyramid project and it's created
00:55 what's called a run configuration, this requires PyCharm Pro,
00:59 PyCharm Community edition doesn't support web apps
01:02 or any sort of web development really,
01:05 so we can come over here and we can expand this out and see what we got;
01:08 Alright, this is what this is generated from our setup
01:11 we can just basically ignore that,
01:13 here's our hidden virtual environment, also ignore that,
01:15 but this is the stuff we really want to edit, here's our views,
01:18 here's our entry point with our routes, all of those kinds of things.
01:23 So I let's just go ahead and run it and make sure everything is working,
01:27 it is, everything is working, so if we click it
01:30 it should come up just like we did before on the command line.
01:33 All right, that's cool, now in case it doesn't come up like this
01:36 you may need to do a couple of things,
01:38 you may need to add a run configuration,
01:41 so you might need to come over here and say plus Pyramid server
01:44 make sure you don't do the default you just hit plus
01:46 and give it a name and you got to browse to the configuration file
01:49 I'll click here so you see give it a name,
01:52 browse to either the development or production any
01:54 set the working directory to be the same
01:56 and make sure you pick your virtual environment
01:59 if it's not there, you've got to go browse, I'll show you how to do that in just a second.
02:03 One final thing that will make life easier is say single instance only,
02:06 only one process can list on that port anyway
02:09 so you just get weird errors if you don't do that.
02:12 So the other thing you do is to go to settings, the preferences here
02:15 and if you go to the project, project interpreter you can see
02:19 you can actually go here and say add a local virtual environment
02:22 or even create a new one, but then you've got to run
02:25 the setup steps again in that new environment.
02:27 So if for some reason it doesn't show up,
02:29 then you can browse over to this, but as long as you follow
02:31 those naming conventions that I went through
02:34 .env for the virtual environment that it's in the root of your project here
02:39 then it should automatically detect it.
02:41 We also have a little terminal down here,
02:44 and the terminal automatically comes with that,
02:46 that virtual environment activated,
02:49 so you can come down here and a lot of that stuff that we did
02:51 with the setup.py and so on, down in this area.
02:54 All right, other than that, it looks like we're up and running and ready to go in PyCharm.
02:59 So, for the rest of the time working on this,
03:01 we'll basically be working in this editor.
03:03 Oh, one final thing before I go, notice it says that
03:06 the version control, the route was not registered,
03:09 so I can come down here, and I can add this
03:12 and this will add version control support to this project,
03:15 notice how everything turned red, that's because it's not yet committed,
03:19 it's not staged in get, so it hasn't been added basically.
03:23 So I've got to go through that, and then it will turn to either white or green
03:27 or blue depending on how I've edited it.
