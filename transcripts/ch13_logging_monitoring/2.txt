00:01 In this course we're going to be using something called logbook.
00:05 Now, logbook is made by Armin Ronacher, the guy who created Flask
00:09 and logbook is really nice; Python comes with built in logging,
00:14 but for some reason it's just not so clean and simple,
00:17 I don't know why, but not so much fun; Logbook made it be more fun,
00:21 so here you can see a really simple example of how you might set it up,
00:24 say we're going to push to standard out, setup a logbook and off it goes,
00:29 and we'll do this in a couple of different ways in our apis,
00:32 but what makes this fun, what about getting log messages to your phone
00:37 or desktop notification system, logbook can do that.
00:40 So logbook has got a bunch of cool features
00:42 and I like it because it's really easy to use,
00:45 and it works well with layered systems,
00:47 so different levels of your web app can have
00:51 different output type messages and so on, so that's really great,
00:54 it's easy to tell where did this error come from
00:57 or what was the sequence of events that led to some log message.
