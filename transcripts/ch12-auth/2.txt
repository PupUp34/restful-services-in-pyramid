00:01  So, we've got our users modeled here,
00:04  we've got them created in the database
00:06  we've got the repository able to query some of them
00:09  but we still have one thing we'd like to take care of.
00:11  If I open this up and I say select star from user
00:15  and I run this, what amazing users do we have, none, no users,
00:20  so there's a couple of things we could do
00:23  we could go and actually manage this like outside of our program
00:26  which I guess would be okay, but then we wouldn't have
00:29  some of those defaults run and things like that,
00:32  so let's just go ahead and add a little bit of work down here,
00:35  let's write one more function that we can do call just to say
00:39  hey let's create some that temporary users,
00:43  so we'll say create test users,
00:46  actually let's just call it like this, create user and we'll pass in a user,
00:49  so what are we going to require, let's go look at the non non default things
00:54  so this we don't have to pass it's auto incrementing
00:57  this we don't have to pass it's got a default,
00:59   this we don't have to pass it as a default,
01:02  this, I don't really know what to set here,
01:04  we're not actually hashing passwords
01:06  and it's not required, so we're not going to pass that.
01:08  So really, all we need is the name actually that's kind of cool.
01:10  So let's go over here and say it's going to take a user name,
01:14  and so we want to create a session
01:15  and then we'll say such user equals user like that
01:20  and then just say name = username and then session.add user
01:26  and don't forget to commit,
01:31  and we can go ahead and pass this back
01:33  and now this should have all those defaults
01:35  set by the database so that will be handy
01:38  all right so now let's go in our little init here just for a moment,
01:40  let's go over here and say repository.add user, create user
01:48  so this will be jeff chloe sarah and mike,
01:55  all right, so we're going to create all those
01:57  so that we can get them back, I guess I get them out with the tools, right
02:01  we could go and print out there their password or the API key that was generated
02:04  but it'll be over here, let's just run this really quick
02:07  now you see it's already done it, so let's comment those out
02:12  so we don't create the same users twice, that would really crash
02:14  because the uniqueness constraints,
02:16  so if we go over here and say a table editor,
02:18  you can see we have our users and there's their API keys right
02:21  no password, some of them created, their auto incremented id, their names and so on.
02:25  So let's copy that, we're going to work on behalf of this user mike for the rest of the time
02:31  so after this we need to talk about how do we take this api key
02:34  and pass this along to our function, how do we get it out,
02:37  what is the convention that we're going to follow, and things like that.
02:40  So now we have for users let's go work on the service.
