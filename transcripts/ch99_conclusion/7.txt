00:01 After content negotiation and the different renderers
00:03 we added validation to our api which was sorely missing up until this point,
00:07 but once we did, the actual validation code simply overwhelmed the api code
00:13 and the important code if you will, by just totally filling up
00:16 so we said let's create this abstraction called a view model
00:19 whose job is to do the validation, to do the transformation
00:22 from original object into rich Python objects and so on.
00:25 So here, after having a super bloated update auto method,
00:29 we condensed it back down, so we're doing the standard web stuff in gray
00:33 so we're getting the request.json_body and we have to do that in the api method
00:37 because there's not really a good way to do that without passing the request itself
00:41 so we just go ahead and say fine we'll have to do this here, a little bit of web work
00:44 and then we create our view model, we give it the initial data,
00:47 call compute details and then it populates its errors response
00:52 which is a list of problems that may have encountered
00:54 and if it has one, it just says hey there's some kind of problem
00:57 like 400 bad response, 404 missing, 403 permission denied, whatever
01:01 and it sends the error text and the status back.
01:04 All right so that orange line or red line section in the middle
01:08 no matter how much validation we add it's going to stay that simple
01:11 and if we want to test the validation,
01:14 we don't need to do that by mocking of the web request in the database
01:17 we just give it this object and we can test that on its own.
01:20 If we make it through that, then we're really down
01:22 to what we wanted to do in the first place,
01:25 take a car, update the database and either say that worked or it didn't.
01:27 So here we're returning the error 400,
01:30 because the repository was doing some validation as well
01:33 but it could also be 500, we need to be more careful
01:39 about the exception type that we're catching
01:41 so like a database exception probably our fault,
01:44 like couldn't connect, some sort of other validation exception,
01:47 well maybe we do 400 here.
