00:01 There it is, the finish line, you've made it!
00:03 Nice work, you've got through all these restful http service concepts
00:08 and because you made it to the finish line,
00:10 because you probably worked through
00:13 and followed along with the demos as you were going to the course
00:16 you now have a new magic power— building restful apis.
00:21 So the big question is— what are you going to build now?
00:25 So I hope you really enjoyed this course and learned a lot from it,
00:28 and think about what you're going to build,
00:30 hopefully you have something really cool
00:32 that now that you can create these apis very easily and you fully understand them,
00:36 you really are going to build something awesome;
00:39 and if you do, be sure to come back and share it with us.
00:41 However, before you go, you you want to take the code and the samples with you,
00:45 so be sure to drop by github.com/mikeyckennedy/restful-services-in-pyramid
00:51 and star and even consider forking that repository,
00:55 so you have an exact copy of how it was when you went through this class.
00:58 So, if you look into the source folder there
01:01 you'll see there's actually a lot of different chapters
01:03 and even different stages like
01:05 step one, step two, step three throughout the code there.
01:08 So I tried to make it so you could pretty easily grab the code from one level
01:14 and start following along at any step that you like,
01:17 hopefully it worked out that way, if not, do let me know
01:20 and I can go back and adjust that for others.
