00:01 Okay, next we came to web building blocks in pyramid.
00:03 So we saw that first thing we had to do is create a route
00:06 and we did this in the dunder init, __init__.py in the main method there
00:11 and we said we have to set up patterns, not regular expressions,
00:14 like some frameworks with just patterns with little template holes in them, if you will
00:18 and we're going to map those over to views.
00:21 Views sometimes known as controllers in the nvc world,
00:24 these are the things that process our requests
00:27 and decide what to send back if anything at all;
00:29 templates, these are the dynamic html views that sometimes we send back,
00:33 this was the home page, this was the doc page, things like that.
00:36 Models, we had several levels of models, the actual thing we return
00:40 were often— often, not always, Python dictionaries
00:44 unless we configure the renderers to treat special types that it knows about.
00:49 But, we also had view models in there,
00:51 which served a slightly different role than the models typically talked about here.
00:54 Static types and static files right, so css, javascript, images,
00:59 we saw that we can map a special part of our web application
01:03 to serve up files and no other part of will.
01:06 We also did a lot with configuration,
01:08 in the beginning we just played with development.ini,
01:11 but as we got to deployment, we saw that the production.ini
01:14 and the ability to have different configurations
01:17 for locally running our code versus running in production,
01:19 turns out to be super helpful.
