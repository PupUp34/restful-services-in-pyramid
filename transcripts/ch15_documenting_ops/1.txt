00:01 In this short chapter we're going to wrap up the course
00:04 by looking at your options for documenting your apis.
00:07 If you have a public api, you really should be documenting it,
00:10 if it's internal, maybe, we'll see.
00:13 So, let's take a look at some of these considerations.
00:15 First of all, how are we going to go about creating these docs,
00:18 do we need them at all— maybe, like I said,
00:21 if it's a public api you absolutely need to have good docs,
00:24 if it's an internal api and you work at a company with a couple of developers,
00:29 maybe just the unittest and an example app is good enough,
00:33 you don't really need to overly document it.
00:35 If you work within a large company or you do an open source,
00:38 you definitely need to document it as well.
00:40 Okay, so let's suppose you've decided, yes, I do want documentation for my api,
00:44 one option is to just host them on read the docs,
00:47 so you go over there, create an account, set that up, that's an option;
00:50 you could host them on github, and by that I mean you just have a repository
00:54 that is a bunch of read me files, or you know mark down files
00:57 that people can browse through.
00:59 An example of this would be basecamp,
01:01 at the beginning of this course we saw that basecamp has
01:04 all of their documentation just as markdown files
01:07 maybe restructured text, one of those two on github, so that's certainly an option.
01:11 You could generate them from a static site generator type thing
01:15 and then just put them up on a web server somewhere,
01:17 that would be fine; so all these things here,
01:20 all of these options kind of leave you to your own devices,
01:22 if you want to go this path they're pretty well documented there.
01:25 But in this section, I want to show you how to actually add the documentation
01:30 to where your api is executing, inside the pyramid web app.
01:34 So we could host them right in this application here,
01:37 or something along those lines okay,
01:40 so you can read the docs about working with read the docs, and things like that,
01:43 but if you want to host them within your app and kind of keep it all bundled together
01:46 then we'll see how to do that, it turns out to be super, super easy.
01:50 So we'll add our documentation and we'll have a couple of pages
01:54 we should probably feature it pretty clearly,
01:56 put a little nice design on it, things like that,
01:58 so here's the page that we might click on, see docs/all_autos
02:02 and this might tell you how to get all of the automobiles from our service, right.
02:06 We saw, as you know, we've been doing this for a while now
02:08 get/api/autos, and that's going to return a json response of this type,
02:13 actually it's going to return, the screenshot might be a little off,
02:16 it is going to return a list of those, right
02:19 so here is the general response,
02:22 and I think the style, there's not much to it,
02:24 but also having it look pretty definitely makes it feel more polished
02:26 and people are more likely to use this api if the documentation looks
02:28 at least somewhat professional, right.
02:31 Now, we'll have another one of these for when we're going to create a car
02:34 so here we are going to post the api/autos the submitted body is this,
02:38 the response options are json and csv
02:40 and they come out like this on the bottom.
02:42 All right, so let's see how we add this to our auto service.
